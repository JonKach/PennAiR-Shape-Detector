Static Image Approach: 
Since the task consisted of identifying and locating shapes from an image, my thought process immediately went to various object segmentation strategies. 
Since my algorithmic solution needed to work on both static images and videos, a technique like background subtraction was not applicable. 
Instead, I opted to go for the most straightforward and computationally simple route, which I believed was edge detection. 
Since each shape, regardless of its color or composition, has a clearly defined edge when compared to the background, 
I knew I could use those details to isolate the shapes from the background image. 
After edges were isolated, I needed to filter out false edges through Gaussian blur and morphological dilation, 
and then find the contours that represented each shape. 

Challenges: I struggled with finding/tuning the appropriate methods to isolate edges effectively and filter out false edges. 
Additionally, I had difficulty ensuring that two overlapping shapes would merge their total area into one outlined region. 
I solved the first of these issues by researching auto-tuning methods for edge detection and applying them to my Canny edge detector. 
Secondly, to ensure overlapping shapes were unified into a single contour, I rendered detected shapes onto a blank canvas, 
applied heavy blurring, and then re-thresholded to obtain merged contours.

This approach successfully isolated major shapes from the background.
